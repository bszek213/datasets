GEDS: Gait Events DataSet
====================

Open dataset of inertial, magnetic, foot-ground contact, and electromyographic signals from wearable sensors during walking at different speeds. These data were acquired from 22 healthy adults using wearable sensors and walking at self-selected comfortable, fast, and slow speeds, and standing still.  
All data are publicly available in the internet (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7778255).  
In total, there are data of 9,661 gait strides. Itâ€™s also provided files with the instants of the gait events identified using the foot-ground contact sensors and notebooks exemplifying how to access and visualize the data.
